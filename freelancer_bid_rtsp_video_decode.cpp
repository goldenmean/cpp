/**************
To achieve real-time monitoring from decoded video streams sourced from surveillance cameras using 
RTSP and encoded in H.264/265, we'll design an architecture that leverages C++ for efficient video
 decoding and processing. This solution will involve several components:

Video Capture Component: To receive the RTSP stream.
Decoder Component: To decode the H.264/265 encoded video frames.
Processing Component: To perform any necessary processing on the decoded frames.
Display Component: To display the processed video frames in real-time.
Architecture Overview
RTSP Server: The surveillance camera acts as an RTSP server streaming video over the network.
Client Application:
Network Communication Layer: Handles RTSP communication with the server.
Video Decoder: Decodes the received H.264/265 video frames.
Frame Processing: Applies any required processing to the decoded frames.
Display Interface: Displays the processed frames in real-time.
Design Details
Network Communication Layer
LibVLC: A cross-platform multimedia framework that supports RTSP streams. It provides bindings for C++, 
allowing us to handle RTSP communication efficiently.
Usage: Initialize LibVLC with RTSP input options, then use it to open the RTSP stream and read packets.
Video Decoder
FFmpeg Libraries: FFmpeg is a comprehensive multimedia framework that includes decoders for H.264/265. 
We'll use FFmpeg's libavcodec library for decoding.
Usage: After receiving the video stream, extract the raw video frames and pass them to the decoder.
 Process the decoded frames as needed.
Frame Processing
Custom Implementation: Depending on the requirements, this could involve applying filters, detecting
 motion, or performing object tracking. The specifics depend on the desired outcome.
Usage: Implement custom algorithms or use existing libraries like OpenCV for frame processing.
Display Interface
OpenCV: A popular library for computer vision tasks, including displaying video frames in real-time.
Usage: Use OpenCV's imshow function to display the processed frames. Ensure the loop that reads and 
processes frames runs at a high enough frequency to maintain real-time playback.
Sample Code Snippet
This snippet demonstrates initializing LibVLC for RTSP stream handling and setting up a basic loop for
 reading and displaying frames. Note that this is a simplified example; actual implementation would 
 require error checking, frame processing, and possibly multithreading for smooth real-time display.
